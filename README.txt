Here is a short description of the plugin.  This should be no more than 150 characters.  No markup here.

== Description ==

The WooCommerce Integration plugin is a robust solution designed to facilitate the integration of the Open edX platform with the WooCommerce e-commerce system. By leveraging the extensive capabilities of WooCommerce, this plugin enables users to easily purchase courses and seamlessly enroll in them through Open edX.

The plugin addresses the challenges posed by the deprecation of the current e-commerce service used in the Open edX community. It provides an alternative solution by integrating Open edX directly with a third-party commerce platform, reducing the maintenance burden and unlocking opportunities for a wider audience to access e-commerce services.

With the WooCommerce Integration plugin, the process of purchasing a course becomes streamlined. When a course is bought in WooCommerce, the plugin automatically creates an enrollment for that course in the Open edX platform. Conversely, if an order is refunded, the associated enrollment is unenrolled, ensuring synchronization between the two systems.

Key features of the plugin include:

* WooCommerce Plugin: A WordPress plugin with WooCommerce as a dependency, offering a robust handler for order actions and easy association of WooCommerce products with Open edX courses. It provides a local record in WordPress for order fulfillment status and allows actions like retry or edit.

* Open edX API: An API endpoint within the Open edX platform that enables the creation of enrollments and synchronization with WooCommerce. The API supports registering enrollments for existing users or creating CourseEnrollmentAllowed objects for new users.

* Extensibility: The plugin is designed to be extensible, allowing WordPress developers to connect custom logic to themes or other plugins through extension points. This flexibility enables power users and developers to handle innovative and complex scenarios related to e-commerce.
